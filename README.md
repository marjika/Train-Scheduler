# Train-Scheduler
This repository is for a Javascript application for homework due June 6, 2018. It contains a Javascript file to run the application, an html and css file, and images.  The styling is created through the use of bootstrap, a css file, and within the html file. The project uses JQuery, Bootstrap, Firebase, and Moment.JS.
The application is designed to allow the user to input train information and then it calculates when the user's next train will come and how many minutes it will be until the next train. There is an input form for the user and a tavle to display the information. Some new things that I tried this time that were required for the assignment were: first: to use the Firebase Database to store and return the inputted values and second: to use moment.js to format and manipulate the times.  Some new things that I was able to complete which were not required include: better error handling (the user was reminded to input the time in the correct format and to input a number for frequency) through the use of a modal if he/she tried to enter information which would not work in the calculations and which would likely return bad values; clear input fields (this took me a while to find the proper format for the number input) after submitting the form; and the use of a regular expression in order to check against the inputted time to ensure it was in the proper format.
This project was created and is maintained by me, Marjika Howarth.
